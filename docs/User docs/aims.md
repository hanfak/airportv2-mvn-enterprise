# Aims

This is aimed at people working in backend enterprise services

This project is a starting point to help juniors in their first role get
familiar with the type of work they will be doing.

For example:

- Architecture of application
- Object oriented design
- Functional Programming
- Testing pyramid, TDD, ATDD/BDD
- Agile
- Using databases in code and setup
- Embedded Server
- Using Apis over http
- Build and dependency tools
- Security 
- Monitoring - logging, health checks, metrics, tracing
- Scheduling Jobs
- Stubbing library
- Concurrency
- Caching
- CI/CD
- Containerisation and container management
- Microservices
- Integration - queues 
- Event sourcing and CQRS

Not everything that will used as a programmer will be done will be shown
here. Different projects require different needs. But using this as a
means to learn and explore and try things out will help with production
work.

This is a resource to use, as way of seeing an example of how a
production like application is built and what it requires.
