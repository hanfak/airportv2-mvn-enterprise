# Infrastructure

- All the lower level details
- Can use frameworks here
- All libraries/frameworks are isolated here to make changes easier
- Hides all the details of how the database gets or stores information for example
- Have multiple implementations setup here, can be used by use cases with them knowing what it is using
- Any objects that used specifically for the framework, needs to be defined here (ie hibernate objects)
