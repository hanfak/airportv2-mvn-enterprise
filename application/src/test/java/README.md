# Tests

Use of "Testing  Pyramid"

Apply TDD

Aim for 100% test coverage (use of test coverage static analysis)

    - Some code do not need to be tested, as they are tested indirectly through other tests (ie integration/end to end) 
        - caveat to this, is using integration tests to make sure slow parts work
